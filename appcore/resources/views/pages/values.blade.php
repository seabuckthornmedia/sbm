                    <h1>Our Responsibility</h1><br>
                    <p>We believe poor design is responsible for the great damage inflicted upon the natural capital on which all life depends on, including ours and that of our children.</p>
                    <p>At Sea Buckthorn Media, this sense of responsibility is reflected on our actions as we extend our passion for design onto the world by designing efficiently our decisions.</p>
                    <p>This is also why we love to support local community groups and keep all our websites powered by renewables.</p><br>
